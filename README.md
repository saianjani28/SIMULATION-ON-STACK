# SIMULATION-ON-STACK
Interactive stack simulation built in C to demonstrate core LIFO operations. It supports push, pop, peek, display, overflow and underflow checks with clear console output. Designed for students to visualize stack behavior and practice data structure concepts through a simple menu-driven program. 
What is a Stack?
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last item inserted is the first to be removed.

Operations Implemented
Push (Insert)
Pop (Delete)
Peek (View top element)
Display (Show all elements)
Applications of Stack
Undo operations in editors
Function call stack (recursion)
Expression evaluation (postfix/prefix)
Checking balanced parentheses
Browser back/forward navigation
